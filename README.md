## Lab: 03 - Extend your 'About Me' and guessing game
i added a lot of things:
- added the numbers game and the user has 4 attempts.
- added a list of colors in an array and the user has to guess my favorite color with only has 6 attempts.
- added 7 questions to the user.
- made a counter that counts the score of the user depending on how many answers he got right.
- in html i added an ordered list for the about me part.
- then i added an unordered list that talks about 10 of my top 10 songs.
- i also added the reset.css file.
- and added the external style.css file instead of keeping it internel, and linked it with my html file.
- added  a new folder that has the external javascript file instead of keeping in it, internel and linked it with my html file.
- added the eslinct file.
- made a new folder to put both reset.css file and style.css inside it.

## learned about 
- we revised the switch statement again
- talked about arrays
- used if else statements
- logical operators
    - Logical and
    - Logical or
    - Logical not
- comprarison operators such as:
    - strict equal
    - not strict equal
    - bigger than
    - smaller than
    - bigger than equals
    - smaller than equals    

- truthy and falsy values: are to check if a variable has a value or not
    - can be NaN, undefined, empty string, null.
- loops :
    - for loops if we know when the loop is going to stop.
    - while loops if we dont know the stopping condition of the loop.
    - do while loops : is used mostly to test hardware. the code will at least run once.       
- continue and break
    - continue skips the the rest of the code for that iteration then continue back to the rest.
    - break to break out of all loop.
- reset.css does which is it refreshes everything before the normal style.css applies to html
